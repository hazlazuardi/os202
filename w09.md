<br><br>  

## 2. [Disk Scheduling Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/disk-scheduling-algorithms/)
1. **FCFS / First Come First Serve** ⏤ The requests are addressed in the order they arrive in the disk queue.
2. **SSTF / Shortest Seek Time First** ⏤ The seek time of every request is calculated in advance in the queue and then they are scheduled according to their calculated seek time. 
3. **SCAN / Elevator Algorithm** ⏤ The disk arm moves into a particular direction and services the requests coming in its path and after reaching the end of disk, it reverses its direction and again services the request arriving in its path.
4. **CSCAN / Circular SCAN** ⏤ The disk arm instead of reversing its direction goes to the other end of the disk and starts servicing the requests from there.
5. **LOOK** ⏤ Similar to SCAN but the disk arm in spite of going to the end of the disk goes only to the last request to be serviced in front of the head and then reverses its direction from there only.
6. **CLOOK / Circular LOOK** ⏤ LOOK but in Circular manner.
7. **LIFO / Last In First Out** ⏤ Well, scheduling randomly.
8. **LIFO / Last In First Out** ⏤ Newest job serviced first.
9. **N-Step SCAN / N-Step LOOK** ⏤ A buffer is created for N requests. 
10. **FSCAN** ⏤ Using two sub-queues.

## 3. [Volatile and Non-volatile Memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-volatile-memory-and-non-volatile-memory/)  
|    | Volatile                                     | Non-Volatile                                               |
|----|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. | Data is lost when powered-off                | Data is remained stored when powered-off                   |
| 2. | Faster, less capacity                        | Slower, more capacity                                      |
| 3. | Can read and write                           | Can only read                                              |
| 4. | Ex: SRAM and DRAM (Random Access Memory)     | Ex: ROM (Read Only Memory)                                 |
| 5. | Forthcoming tech : Z-RAM,TTRAM,A-RAM,ETA RAM | Forthcoming tech : FeRAM,,SONOS,Racetrack Memory, Milipede |

## 4. [Error Detection and Correction](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/error_codes.htm)  
### **In Peterson’s solution, we have two shared variables:**
This is a fundamental aspect of many parts of computing. Error detection determines if there a problem has occurred by parity bit or cyclic redundancy check (CRC) which uses hash function to detect multiple bit errors. Error-correction code (ECC) not only detects, but can correct some errors (only soft errors).

## 5. [Disk Formatting](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/disk-formatting/)  
![Disk Formatting](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200516215034/1406-4.png)  

**Disk Formatting** ⏤  process to configure the data-storage devices such as hard-drive, floppy disk and flash drive when we are going to use them for the very first time or we can say initial usage
<br><br> 


## 6. [Swap-Space Management](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/process-synchronization#)  
![Swap-Space Management](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200525125013/3164-1.png)  

**Swapping** is is a memory management technique used in multi-programming to increase the number of process sharing the CPU. The goal of this swap-space implementation is to provide the virtual memory the best throughput.

## 7. [Storage Attachment](https://padakuu.com/article/108-disk-attachment)  
Two ways computers access disk storage:

1. **Host-Attached Storage** ⏤ Common on small systems. Including SATA, and other I/O ports.  

2. **NAS / Network-Attached Storage**  ⏤ a special-purpose storage system that is accessed remotely over a data network
<br><br>


## 8. [RAID?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/raid-redundant-arrays-of-independent-disks/)  
**“Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks”** ⏤ is a technique which makes use of a combination of multiple disks instead of using a single disk for increased performance, data redundancy or both.
<br><br>


## 9. [RAID Evaluation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/raid-redundant-arrays-of-independent-disks/)  

**1. Reliability**  
How many disk faults can the system tolerate?  

**2. Availability**  
What fraction of the total session time is a system in uptime mode, i.e. how available is the system for actual use?

**3. Performance**  
How good is the response time? How high is the throughput (rate of processing work)? Note that performance contains a lot of parameters and not just the two.

**4. Capacity**  
Given a set of N disks each with B blocks, how much useful capacity is available to the user?

<br><br>  


## 10. [RAID Levels](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/raid-redundant-arrays-of-independent-disks/)  

### **1. RAID 0**  
- **Reliability: 0** ⏤ There is no duplication of data. Hence, a block once lost cannot be recovered.
- **Capacity: (N x B)** ⏤ The entire space is being used to store data. Since there is no duplication, N disks each having B blocks are fully utilized.

### **2. RAID 1 (Mirroring)**  
- **Reliability: 1 to N/2** ⏤ 1 disk failure can be handled for certain, because blocks of that disk would have duplicates on some other disk.
- **Capacity: (N x B)/2** ⏤ Only half the space is being used to store data. The other half is just a mirror to the already stored data.

### **3. RAID 4 (Block-Level Stripping with Dedicated Parity**  
- **Reliability: 1** ⏤ RAID-4 allows recovery of at most 1 disk failure (because of the way parity works). If more than one disk fails, there is no way to recover the data.
- **Capacity: B x (N-1)** ⏤ One disk in the system is reserved for storing the parity. Hence, (N-1) disks are made available for data storage, each disk having B blocks.

### **4. RAID 5 (Block-Level Stripping with Distributed Parity**  
- **Reliability: 1** ⏤ RAID-5 allows recovery of at most 1 disk failure (because of the way parity works). If more than one disk fails, there is no way to recover the data. This is identical to RAID-4.
- **Capacity: B x (N-1)** ⏤ Overall, space equivalent to one disk is utilized in storing the parity. Hence, (N-1) disks are made available for data storage, each disk having B blocks.

### **5. Other Levels**
1. **RAID 2** ⏤ consists of bit-level striping using a Hamming Code parity. RAID-3 consists of byte-level striping with a dedicated parity. These two are less commonly used.
2. **RAID 6** ⏤ contains a distributed double parity, which involves block-level striping with 2 parity bits instead of just 1 distributed across all the disks.

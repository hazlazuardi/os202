# Top 10 List of Week 07

## 1. [Processes Synchronization](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/process-synchronization#)
Process Synchronization means sharing system resources by processes in a such a way that, Concurrent access to shared data is handled thereby minimizing the chance of inconsistent data.
<br><br>  

## 2. [Critical Section Problem](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/process-synchronization#)
![Critical Section Problem](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/images/critical-section-problem.png)  
It means that in a group of cooperating processes, at a given point of time, only one process must be executing its critical section. If any other process also wants to execute its critical section, it must wait until the first one finishes.  
<br><br>  


## 3. [Solutions to Critical Section Problem](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/process-synchronization)  

**1. Mutual Exclusion**  
Out of a group of cooperating processes, only one process can be in its critical section at a given point of time.  

**2. Progress**  
If no process is in its critical section, and if one or more threads want to execute their critical section then any one of these threads must be allowed to get into its critical section.  

**3. Bounded Waiting**  
After a process makes a request for getting into its critical section, there is a limit for how many other processes can get into their critical section, before this process's request is granted. So after the limit is reached, system must grant the process permission to get into its critical section.

## 4. [Peterson's Solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-process-synchronization/?ref=lbp)  
### **In Peterson’s solution, we have two shared variables:**
**1. boolean flag[i]**  
Initialized to FALSE, initially no one is interested in entering the critical section.  

**2. int turn**  
The process whose turn is to enter the critical section.

## 5. [Semaphores](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/semaphores-in-process-synchronization/?ref=lbp)  
 **Semaphore** (by Dijkstra) is a very significant technique to manage concurrent processes by using a simple integer value. Semaphore is simply a variable which is non-negative and shared between threads. 
 ### **Two types of Semaphores:**  

 **1. Binary Semaphore / Mutex Lock**  
It can have only two values – 0 and 1. Its value is initialized to 1. It is used to implement the solution of critical section problem with multiple processes.  

 **2. Counting Semaphore**   
Its value can range over an unrestricted domain. It is used to control access to a resource that has multiple instances.

## 6. [Mutex Lock](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/process-synchronization#)  
In this approach, in the entry section of code, a LOCK is acquired over the critical resources modified and used inside critical section, and in the exit section that LOCK is released.

As the resource is locked while a process executes its critical section hence no other process can access it.<br><br>  


## 7. [Differences Between Binary Semaphores and Mutex](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-binary-semaphore-and-mutex/?ref=rp)  
| Parameter 	| Binary Semaphore 	| Mutex 	|
|-	|-	|-	|
| Functions 	| Its functions based up on signalling mechanism 	| Its functions based up on locking mechanism 	|
| Thread 	| The thread which is having higher priority than current thread can also release binary semaphore and take lock. 	| The thread which has acquired mutex can only release Mutex when it exits from critical section. 	|
| Values 	| Semaphore value is changed according to wait () and signal () operations. 	| Mutex values can be modified just as locked or unlocked. 	|
| Number of Thread(s) 	| Multiple number of threads can acquire binary semaphore at a time concurrently. 	| Only one thread can acquire mutex at a time 	|
| Ownership 	| Binary semaphore have no ownership. 	| There is ownership associated with mutex because only owner can release the lock. 	|
| Speed 	| They are faster than mutex because any other thread/process can unlock binary semaphore. 	| They are slower than binary semaphores because only thread which has acquired must release the lock. 	|
| Best Use Case 	| If you have number of instances for resource it is better to use Binary semaphore. 	| If you have single instance for resource it is better to use mutex. 	|

## 8. [Deadlocks](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/deadlocks)  
![Deadlock](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/images/deadlock.png)  
**Deadlocks** are a set of blocked processes each holding a resource and waiting to acquire a resource held by another process.
### **How to Avoid Deadlock**

**1. Mutual Exclusion**  
Resources shared such as read-only files do not lead to deadlocks but resources, such as printers and tape drives, requires exclusive access by a single process.  

**2. Hold and Wait**  
In this condition processes must be prevented from holding one or more resources while simultaneously waiting for one or more others.  

**3. No Preemption**  
Preemption of process resource allocations can avoid the condition of deadlocks, where ever possible.  

**4. Circular Wait**  
Circular wait can be avoided if we number all resources, and require that processes request resources only in strictly increasing(or decreasing) order.
<br><br>


## 9. [Dealing with Deadlocks](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/deadlocks)  

**1. Preemption**  
We can take a resource from one process and give it to other. This will resolve the deadlock situation, but sometimes it does causes problems.  

**2. Rollback**  
In situations where deadlock is a real possibility, the system can periodically make a record of the state of each process and when deadlock occurs, roll everything back to the last checkpoint, and restart, but allocating resources differently so that deadlock does not occur.  

**3. Kill one or more processes**  
This is the simplest way, but it works.

# Top 10 List of Week 00  

1. An Operating System (OS) is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware. 
An operating system is a software which performs all the basic tasks like file management, 
memory management, process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral 
devices such as disk drives and printers.


2. Studying OS is beneficial as almost all code runs on top of an operating system, knowledge 
of how operating system work is crucial to proper, efficient, effective and secure programming. 
It is not essential not only to those who program them, but also highly useful for those who 
write programs on them and use them.


3. The Von Neumann Model is basically a computer architecture based on a stored-program concept
introduced by John Von Neumann. 
The architecture has 3 basic structure: 
- The Central Processing Unit (CPU),
- The Main Memory Unit
- The Input/Output
The CPU contains all the component for doing computation, e.g ALU.
The Main Memory Unit is for storing and retrieving large data.
I/O is basically for the interaction between users and computers.


4. There are 3 key aspects of Computer-system organization:
- Interrupts  
- Storage  
- I/O structure  


5. Definitions of computer system components
- CPU : The hardware that executes instructions.
- Processor : A physical chip that contains one or more CPUs
- Core : The basic computation unit of CPU
- Multicore : Including multiple computing cores on the same CPU
- Multiprocessor : Including multiple processors


6. Differences between SDRAM, DDR, DDR2, DDR3, and DDR4:
- SDRAM / Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory:
Unlike previous technologies, SDRAM is designed to synchronize itself with the timing of the CPU. 
This enables the memory controller to know the exact clock cycle when the requested data will be 
ready, so the CPU no longer has to wait between memory accesses.
- DDR / Double Data Rate SDRAM:
The next generation of SDRAM is DDR, which achieves greater bandwidth than the preceding single 
data rate SDRAM by transferring data on the rising and falling edges of the clock signal 
(double pumped). Effectively, it doubles the transfer rate without increasing the frequency of 
the clock. The transfer rate of DDR SDRAM is the double of SDR SDRAM without changing the internal 
clock.
- DDR2:
Its primary benefit is the ability to operate the external data bus twice as fast as DDR SDRAM. 
This is achieved by improved bus signal. The prefetch buffer of DDR2 is 4 bit(double of DDR SDRAM). 
DDR2 memory is at the same internal clock speed (133~200MHz) as DDR,  but the transfer rate of DDR2 
can reach 533~800 MT/s with the improved I/O bus signal.
- DDR3:
DDR3 memory reduces 40% power consumption compared to current DDR2 modules, allowing for lower operating 
currents and voltages (1.5 V, compared to DDR2's 1.8 V or DDR's 2.5 V). The transfer rate of DDR3 is 
800~1600 MT/s. DDR3's prefetch buffer width is 8 bit, whereas DDR2's is 4 bit, and DDR's is 2 bit. 
DDR3 also adds two functions, such as ASR (Automatic Self-Refresh) and SRT (Self-Refresh Temperature). 
They can make the memory control the refresh rate according to the temperature variation.
- DDR4:
DDR4 SDRAM provides the lower operating voltage (1.2V) and higher transfer rate. The transfer rate of 
DDR4 is 2133~3200 MT/s. DDR4 adds four new Bank Groups technology. Each bank group has the feature of 
singlehanded operation. DDR4 can process 4 data within a clock cycle, so DDR4's efficiency is better 
than DDR3 obviously. DDR4 also adds some functions, such as DBI (Data Bus Inversion), CRC 
(Cyclic Redundancy Check) and CA parity. They can enhance DDR4 memory's signal integrity, and improve 
the stability of data transmission/access.


7. Multiprogramming, Multiprocessing, Multitasking, Multithreading:
- Multiprogramming: A computer running more than one program at a time. In a modern computing system, 
there are usually several concurrent application processes which want to execute. Now it is the 
responsibility of the Operating System to manage all the processes effectively and efficiently. 
Multiprogramming increases CPU utilization, as well as keeping users satisfied.
- Multiprocessing: A computer using more than one CPU at a time.
- Multitasking: Tasks sharing a common resource (like 1 CPU). Multitasking is an extension of multiprogramming. 
In multitasking systems, the CPU executes multiple processes by switching among them, but the switches occur 
frequently, providing the user with a fast response time.
- Multithreading: an extension of multitasking


8. Types of OS:  
- Free OS: sometimes referred to as free/libre software, not only makes source code abvailable but also 
is licensed to allow no-cost use, redistribution, and modification  
- Open-source OS: the souce code is available, but does not necessarily offer license like Free OS (GNU/Linux)  
- Closed-source OS: sometimes referred to as proprietary software, owns the OS, restricts its use, and 
carefully protects its source code (Windows)  
- Hybrid OS: It usually contains an open-source kernel but includes proprietary, closed-source components 
as well (Apple's MacOS)  


9. Reasons people prefer using open source software: 
- Starting with a source code allows the programmer to produce binary code that can be executed on a system. 
Doing the opposite (binary to code), well known as reverse engineering, is quite a lot of work, and useful 
items such as comments are never recovered.
- Students can modify the OS and then compile and run the code to try out those changes.
- Arguably, open-source code is more secure than closed-source code because many more eyes are viewing the code.
- Many unpaid programmers contribute to the code by helping to write it, debug it, analyze, provide support 
and suggest changes.


10. Clustered System:
The Clustered Systems are a combination of hardware clusters and software clusters. The hardware clusters 
help in sharing of high performance disks between the systems. The software clusters makes all the systems 
work together.

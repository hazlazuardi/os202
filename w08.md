# Top 10 List of Week 08

## 1. [CPU Burst](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwi-vq-jmqrtAhUayTgGHRicBLwQFjABegQIBxAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww2.cs.uregina.ca%2F~hamilton%2Fcourses%2F330%2Fnotes%2Fscheduling%2Fscheduling.html&usg=AOvVaw0ISyWL6VFdmxU4tdWnJ38l)
The amount of time the process uses the processor before it is no longer ready.  
<br><br>  

## 2. [CPU Scheduling](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/cpu-scheduling#)  
CPU Scheduling is a process which allows one process to use the CPU while the execution of another process is on hold(in waiting state) due to unavailability of any resource like I/O etc, thereby making full use of CPU. The aim of CPU scheduling is to make the system efficient, fast and fair.  
<br><br>  


## 3. [CPU Scheduler](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling.htm)  
Also known as **short term scheduler** or **dispatcher**, is a special program which work like a followup to scheduler. The scheduler is the one who manage the order but the dispatcher is like the one who execute it.  
<br><br>  


## 4. [Dispatcher](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-dispatcher-and-scheduler/)  
The dispatcher is the module that gives control of the CPU to the process selected by the scheduler. This function involves:
- Switching context.
- Switching to user mode.
- Jumping to the proper location in the newly loaded program.  
<br><br>  


## 5. [First Come First Serve Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-fcfs-cpu-scheduling-set-1/)  
Simplest scheduling algorithm that schedules according to arrival times of processes. First come first serve scheduling algorithm states that the process that requests the CPU first is allocated the CPU first. It is implemented by using the FIFO queue.
<br><br> 

## 6. [Convoy Effects](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convoy-effect-operating-systems/?ref=lbp)  
![Convoy Effects](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/222-2.png)  
**Convoy Effect ⏤** Phenomenon associated with the First Come First Serve (FCFS) algorithm, in which the whole Operating System slows down due to few slow processes.  
<br><br>  

## 7. [Shortest & Longest Job First Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-systems/)  
**Shortest JF ⏤** Process which have the shortest burst time are scheduled first.If two processes have the same bust time then FCFS is used to break the tie. It is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm.  
**Longest JF ⏤** The same as SJF, but the longest is the priority.

## 8. [Differences Between Preemptive & Non-preemptive Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/preemptive-and-non-preemptive-scheduling/?ref=lbp)  
| Parameter       | Preemptive                                                                                                | Non-Preemptive                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Basic           | In this resources(CPU Cycle) are allocated to a process for a limited time.                               | Once resources(CPU Cycle) are allocated to a process, the process holds it till it completes its burst time or switches to waiting state. |
| Interrupt       | Process can be interrupted in between.                                                                    | Process can not be interrupted until it terminates itself or its time is up.                                                              |
| Starvation      | If a process having high priority frequently arrives in the ready queue, low priority process may starve. | If a process with long burst time is running CPU, then later coming process with less CPU burst time may starve.                          |
| Overhead        | It has overheads of scheduling the processes.                                                             | No overheads                                                                                                                              |
| Flexibility     | Flexible                                                                                                  | Rigid                                                                                                                                     |
| Cost            | Cost associated                                                                                           | No cost associated                                                                                                                        |
| CPU Utilization | High                                                                                                      | Low                                                                                                                                       |

## 8. [Thread Scheduling](https://www.iitk.ac.in/esc101/05Aug/tutorial/essential/threads/priority.html)  
Execution of multiple threads on a single CPU in some order is called scheduling. The Java runtime environment supports a very simple, deterministic scheduling algorithm called fixed-priority scheduling. This algorithm schedules threads on the 
basis of their priority relative to other Runnable threads.
<br><br>
<br>   


## 9. [Real-Time CPU Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scheduling-in-real-time-systems/)  
Real-time systems are those in which the time at which tasks complete is crucial to their performance
- **Soft real-time systems** have degraded performance if their timing needs cannot be met. Example: streaming video.
- **Hard real-time systems** have total failure if their timing needs cannot be met. Examples: Assembly line robotics, automobile air-bag deployment.  
<br><br>  


## 10. [Non-uniform Memory Access](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-uniform-memory-access-uma-and-non-uniform-memory-access-numa/)  
**NUMA(Non-uniform Memory Access) ⏤** is a computer memory design where multiple processors working under a single operating system access each other's memory over a common bus or "interconnect" path.

# Top 10 List of Week 05

## 1. [Virtual Memory](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_virtual_memory.htm)
A computer can address more memory than the amount physically installed on the system. This extra memory is actually called **virtual memory** and it is a section of a hard disk that's set up to emulate the computer's RAM. The main visible advantage of this scheme is that programs can be larger than physical memory. 
<br> Virtual memory is implemented using Demand Paging or Demand Segmentation.  
<br><br>  


## 2. [Demand Paging](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)

The process of loading the page into memory on demand (whenever page fault occurs) is known as demand paging.

### **The process:**
1. If CPU try to refer a page that is currently not available in the main memory, it generates an interrupt indicating memory access fault.
2. The OS puts the interrupted process in a blocking state. For the execution to proceed the OS must bring the required page into the memory.
3. The OS will search for the required page in the logical address space.
4. The required page will be brought from logical address space to physical address space. The page replacement algorithms are used for the decision making of replacing the page in physical address space.
5. The page table will updated accordingly.
6. The signal will be sent to the CPU to continue the program execution and it will place the process back into ready state.

## 3. [Page Replacement Algorithm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_virtual_memory.htm)  

### The following are page repacement algorithms
1. First In First Out (FIFO) algorithm  
2. Optimal Page Algorithm**  
3. Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm 
4. Page Buffering algorithm
5. Least frequently Used(LFU) algorithm
6. Most frequently Used(MFU) algorithm  
<br><br>


## 4. [First in First out Algorithm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_virtual_memory.htm)  
![FIFO Algorithm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/fifo.jpg)  
- Oldest page in main memory is the one which will be selected for replacement.
- Easy to implement, keep a list, replace pages from the tail and add new pages at the head.  

### Advantages
It is simple and easy to understand & implement.  

### Disadvantages
- The process effectiveness is low.
- When we increase the number of frames while using FIFO, we are giving more memory to processes. So, page fault should decrease, but here the page faults are increasing. This problem is called as Belady’s Anomaly.
- Every frame needs to be taken account off.
<br><br> 


## 5. [Optimal Page Algorithm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_virtual_memory.htm)  
![Optimal Page Algorithm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/opr.jpg)  
- An optimal page-replacement algorithm has the lowest page-fault rate of all algorithms. An optimal page-replacement algorithm exists, and has been called OPT or MIN.
- Replace the page that will not be used for the longest period of time. Use the time when a page is to be used.  

### Advantages  
- Complexity is less and easy to implement.
- Assistance needed is low i.e Data Structure used are easy and light.  

### Disadvantages  
- OPR is perfect, but not possible in practice as the operating system cannot know future requests.
- Error handling is tough.
<br><br> 


## 6. [Least Recently Used Algorithm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_virtual_memory.htm)  
![LRU Algorithm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/lru.jpg)  
- Page which has not been used for the longest time in main memory is the one which will be selected for replacement.
- Easy to implement, keep a list, replace pages by looking back into time.  

### Advantages  
- It is open for full analysis.
- In this, we replace the page which is least recently used, thus free from Belady’s Anomaly.
- Easy to choose page which has faulted and hasn’t been used for a long time.  

### Disadvantages  
- It requires additional Data Structure to be implemented.
- Hardware assistance is high.

## 7. [Bélády’s Anomaly](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/beladys-anomaly-in-page-replacement-algorithms/?ref=rp)  

**Bélády’s anomaly** is the name given to the phenomenon where increasing the number of page frames results in an increase in the number of page faults for a given memory access pattern.  
Generally, on increasing the number of frames to a process’ virtual memory, its execution becomes faster as less number of page faults occur. Sometimes the reverse happens. This most unexpected result is termed as Belady’s Anomaly.  

Bélády’s anomaly usually occurs in following page replacement algorithm:  
- First in first out (FIFO)
- Second chance algorithm
- Random page replacement algorithm<br>

Stack based algorithm like Optimal, LRU and LFU don't have the phenomenon becuase because they assign a priority to a page (for replacement) that is independent of the number of page frames.
<br><br>


## 8. [Reference String](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_virtual_memory.htm)  
Reference string is the string of memory references. Reference strings are generated artificially or by tracing a given system and recording the address of each memory reference. The latter choice produces a large number of data, where we note two things.  
- For a given page size, we need to consider only the page number, not the entire address.
- If we have a reference to a page p, then any immediately following references to page p will never cause a page fault. Page p will be in memory after the first reference; the immediately following references will not fault.  
- For example, consider the following sequence of addresses − 123,215,600,1234,76,96  
- If page size is 100, then the reference string is 1,2,6,12,0,0

## 9. [Overlays](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overlays-in-memory-management/?ref=lbp)  
### “The process of transferring a block of program code or other data into internal memory, replacing what is already stored”.  
The concept of overlays is that whenever a process is running it will not use the complete program at the same time, it will use only some part of it.Then overlays concept says that whatever part you required, you load it an once the part is done, then you just unload it, means just pull it back and get the new part you required and run it.

## 10. [Advantage & Disadvantage of Overlays](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overlays-in-memory-management/?ref=lbp)  

### Advantage 
- Reduce memory requirement
- Reduce time requirement
- Disadvantage –

### Disadvantage
- Overlap map must be specified by programmer
- Programmer must know memory requirement
- Overlaped module must be completely disjoint
- Programmming design of overlays structure is complex and not possible in all cases

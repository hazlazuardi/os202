# Top 10 List of Week 06

## 1. [Concurrency](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/concurrency-in-operating-system/)
**Concurrency** is the execution of the multiple instruction sequences at the same time. It happens in the operating system when there are several process threads running in parallel.  
<br><br>  


## 2. [Fork System Call](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fork-system-call/)

Fork system call is used for creating a new process, which is called child process, which runs concurrently with the process that makes the fork() call (parent process). After a new child process is created, both processes will execute the next instruction following the fork() system call.

### **Values Returned by fork()**  
1. **Negative Value**  
Unsuccessful child process creation
2. **Zero**  
Return child process
3. **Positive Value**  
Returned to parent, containing process ID of newly created child process
<br><br>  


## 3. [Parent Process](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/process-vs-parent-process-vs-child-process)  

![Parent and Child Process](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assets/questions/media/12675/Parent%20and%20Child%20Process.PNG)  
The process that used the fork() system call is the parent process. In other words, a parent process is one that creates a child process. A parent process may have multiple child processes but a child process only one parent process.  
<br><br>


## 4. [Child Process](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/process-vs-parent-process-vs-child-process)  
A child process is a process created by a parent process in operating system using a fork() system call. A child process may also be called a subprocess or a subtask.

A child process is created as its parent process’s copy and inherits most of its attributes. If a child process has no parent process, it was created directly by the kernel.<br><br> 


## 5. [Process ID](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/pid.htm)  
**Process ID or Process Identifier** is a unique number that identifies each running processes in an operating system, such as Linux, Unix, macOS, and Microsoft Windows.  
In Windows, we can **list all tasks** and associated PID by using tasklist command and ps command for Unix and Linux users.  
Another use of PID is to **kill a process** using kill command (Unix / Linux) or taskkill command (Windows)
<br><br> 


## 6. [Parent Process ID](https://delightlylinux.wordpress.com/2012/06/25/what-is-pid-and-ppid/)  
![PPID](https://delightlylinux.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/pid.png)  
The PPID is the PID of the process’s parent. Each process is assigned a parent process ID (PPID) that tells which process started it.  
One of the important use of PPID is to kill a zombie process⏤a process in which has already dead but still running, causing a waste of memory/resource.
<br><br>  


## 7. [Wait System Call](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wait-system-call-c/)  
![PPID](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Wait_system_call_in_c.jpg)  

A call to wait() blocks the calling process until one of its child processes exits or a signal is received. After child process terminates, parent continues its execution after wait system call instruction.

## 8. [Differences Between Process and Thread](https://www.guru99.com/difference-between-process-and-thread.html)  
| Parameter 	| Process 	| Thread 	|
|-	|-	|-	|
| Definition 	| Process means a program is in execution. 	| Thread means a segment of a process. 	|
| Resource 	| Process consume more resources. 	| Thread consume fewer resources. 	|
| Treatment by OS 	| Different process are tread separately by OS. 	| All the level peer threads are treated as a single task by OS. 	|
| Memory 	| The process is mostly isolated. 	| Threads share memory. 	|
| Communication Time 	| Communication between processes needs more time compared to thread. 	| Communication between threads requires less time compared to processes. 	|
| Termination Time 	| The process takes more time to terminate. 	| The thread takes less time to terminate. 	|
<br><br>


## 9. [Multithreading](https://www.guru99.com/difference-between-process-and-thread.html)  
**Multithreading** refers to multiple threads of execution within an operating system. In simple terms, two or more threads of a same process are executing simultaneously.
<br><br>


## 10. [Process](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_processes.htm)  
To put it in simple terms, we write our computer programs in a text file and when we execute this program, it becomes a process which performs all the tasks mentioned in the program.

# Top 10 List of Week 02

### 1. The Term Protection and Security, are they distinguishable?
- **Security** is a measure of con- fidence that the integrity of a system and its data will be preserved. 
It involves guarding computer resources against unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, destruction 
or disruption.
- **Protection** is a set of mechanisms that control the access of processes and users to the resources defined
by a computer system. 
<br>

### 2. Forms of Security Breach
- **Breach of Confidentiality**<br> Involves unauthorized reading of data. Usually, the intruder captures secret data from a system / data stream.
- **Breach of Integrity**<br> Involves unauthorized modification of data.
- **Breach of Availability**<br> Involves unauthorized destruction of data. Some attackers would rather wreak havoc and get status or bragging rights than gain financially. 
- **Theft of Service**<br> Involves unauthorized use of resources. For example, an intruder (or intrusion program) may install a daemon on a system that acts as a file server.
- **Denial of Service**<br> Involves preventing legitimate use of the system. Denial-of-service (DOS) attacks are sometimes accidental. 
<br>

### 3. Four Levels of Security Measures
- **Physical**<br>
Both the machine rooms and the terminals or computers that have access to the target machines must be secured, 
for example by limiting access to the building they reside in, or locking them to the desk on which they sit.
- **Network**<br>
Networking provides a means for the system to access external resources but also provides a potential vector 
for unauthorized access to the system itself. Intercepting these data can be just as harmful as breaking into a computer.
- **Operating System**<br> 
Operating systems must thus be kept up to date (via continuous patching) and “hardened”—configured 
and modified to decrease the attack surface and avoid penetration. **Attack Surface** is the set of points at which an attacker 
can try to break into the system.
- **Application**<br> 
Third-party applications may also pose risks, especially if they possess significant privileges.
It is virtually impossible to ensure that all such applications are secure due to its vast number of 3rd party apps & their disparate code bases.
<br>

### 4. Four-Layered Security Model
- **Application**<br>
Attacks : Logic bugs, design flaws, code injections<br>
Prevention: Sandboxing, software restrictions
- **OS**<br>
Attacks: Insecure defaults, platform vulnerabilities<br>
Prevention: Patches, configuration, hardening
- **Network**<br>
Attacks:  Sniffing, spoofing, masquerading<br>
Prevention: Encryption, authentication, filtering
- **Physical**<br>
Attacks: Console access, hardware-based attacks<br>
Prevention: Guards, vaults, device data encryption
<br>

### 5. Types of Program Threats
- **Malware**<br>
Software designed to exploit, disable or damage computer system. (Trojan horse, trojan mules, spyware, ransomware)
- **Code Injection**<br>
Adding or modifying executable code
- **Viruses and Worms**<br>
A virus is a fragment of code embedded in a legitimate program. Viruses are self-replicating and are designed to infect other programs.
It works by modifying or destroying files and causing system crashes and program malfunctions.
<br>

### 6. Types of System and Network Threats
- **Attacking Network traffic**<br>
An attacker can be passive (sniffing) or active (masquerading/spoofing or man in the middle)
- **Denial of Service**<br>
The service is put out of action as the packets sent over the network to overload the server’s capabilities and make the server unavailable to other 
devices and users throughout the network. DoS attacks are used to shut down individual machines and networks so that they can’t be used by other users.
- **Port Scanning**<br>
Hacker will detect a system's vulnerabilities to attack
<br>

### 7. Cryptography
Cryptography is the system by which data and information are stored or transmitted in a manner that allows only those for whom it is intended to read, 
interpret or process it using a system of encryption. Cryptography is used to secure data in transmission, data in storage, and user authentication.
There are three types of cryptography: secret-key, public key and hash function.

### 8. 3 common ways to guess a password
- **Trivially**<br>
Human / Program already knows the password.
- **Brute Force**<br>
Trying all possible combinations of valid password characters until the password is found.
- **Dictionary attacks**<br>
Where all words, word variations, and common passwords are tried.
<br>

### 9. [Is it a password or a passphrase? Which One is Better?](https://www.passworddragon.com/password-vs-passphrase#:~:text=The%20difference%20between%20password%20and%20passphrase&text=It%20could%20be%20a%20string,such%20as%20%E2%80%9CB%403!&text=The%20main%20difference%20of%20the,any%20random%20string%20of%20letters.)
People commonly use the term password and passphrase interchangeably. Their purpose are the same, which is a string containing characters to secure
something. The main difference of the two is that passwords do not have spaces while passphrases have spaces and are longer than any random string of letters.
The benefits of using passphrase are:
- Easier to remember
- Relatively harder to guess / crack compared to password
- Satisfies complex rules easily
- Passphrase are next to impossible to crack
Using passphrase, people can satisfy the requirements for passwords without actually need to remember all the random characters because
phrases that is used may already satisfy the requirements.

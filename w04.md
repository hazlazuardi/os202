# Top 10 List of Week 04

### 1. [Memory Management](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_memory_management.htm)
Memory management is the functionality of an operating system which handles or manages primary memory and moves processes back and forth between main memory and disk during execution. Memory management keeps track of each and every memory location, regardless of either it is allocated to some process or it is free. It checks how much memory is to be allocated to processes. It decides which process will get memory at what time. It tracks whenever some memory gets freed or unallocated and correspondingly it updates the status.<br>

### 2. [Memory Adrresses](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_memory_management.htm)

- **Symbolic Addresses**  
The addresses used in a source code. The variable names, constants, and instruction labels are the basic elements of the symbolic address space.  

- **Relative Addresses**  
At the time of compilation, a compiler converts symbolic addresses into relative addresses.  

- **Phyisical Addresses** 
The loader generates these addresses at the time when a program is loaded into main memory.

### 3. [Characteristic of Memory Hierarchy Design](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-hierarchy-design-and-its-characteristics/)  

1. **Capacity**  
It is the global volume of information the memory can store. As we move from top to bottom in the Hierarchy, the capacity increases.<br> 

2. **Access Time**  
It is the time interval between the read/write request and the availability of the data. As we move from top to bottom in the Hierarchy, the access time increases.

3. **Performance**  
Earlier when the computer system was designed without Memory Hierarchy design, the speed gap increases between the CPU registers and Main Memory due to large difference in access time. This results in lower performance of the system and thus, enhancement was required. This enhancement was made in the form of Memory Hierarchy Design because of which the performance of the system increases. One of the most significant ways to increase system performance is minimizing how far down the memory hierarchy one has to go to manipulate data.  

2. **Cost per bit**  
As we move from bottom to top in the Hierarchy, the cost per bit increases i.e. Internal Memory is costlier than External Memory.

### 4. [Logical and Physical Address in OS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/)  
| Parameter     | Logical Address                                                                                       | Physical Address                                                                                    |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Basic         | Generated by CPU                                                                                      | Location in a memory unit                                                                           |
| Address Space | Logical Address Space  is set of all logical  addresses generated by  CPU in reference to a  program. | Physical Address is set of  all physical addresses mapped  to the corresponding logical  addresses. |
| Visibility    | User can view the logical address of a program.                                                       | User can never view physical address of program.                                                    |
| Generation    | generated by the CPU                                                                                  | Computed by MMU                                                                                     |
| Access        | The user can use the logical address to access the physical address.                                  | The user can indirectly access physical address but not directly.                                   |

### 5. [Paging](https://www.guru99.com/paging-in-operating-system.html)  
Paging is a storage mechanism that allows OS to retrieve processes from the secondary storage into the main memory in the form of pages. In the Paging method, the main memory is divided into small fixed-size blocks of physical memory, which is called frames. The size of a frame should be kept the same as that of a page to have maximum utilization of the main memory and to avoid external fragmentation. Paging is used for faster access to data, and it is a logical concept.

### 6. [Page Table Entries in Page Table](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-directory-implementation#:~:text=There%20is%20the%20number%20of,data%20structure%20they%20are%20using.)  
<br>

![Page Table Entry](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Capture-24.png)
1. **Frame Number**<br>
It gives the frame number in which the current page you are looking for is present. The number of bits required depends on the number of frames.Frame bit is also known as address translation bit.  

2. **Present/Absent bit**<br>
Present or absent bit says whether a particular page you are looking for is present or absent. In case if it is not present, that is called Page Fault. It is set to 0 if the corresponding page is not in memory. Used to control page fault by the operating system to support virtual memory. Sometimes this bit is also known as valid/invalid bits.  

3. **Protection bit**<br>
Protection bit says that what kind of protection you want on that page. So, these bit for the protection of the page frame (read, write etc).  

4. **Referenced bit**<br>
Referenced bit will say whether this page has been referred in the last clock cycle or not. It is set to 1 by hardware when the page is accessed.

5. **Caching enabled/disabled**<br>
The information present in the closest level to the CPU and the information present in the closest level to the user might be different. So we want the information has to be consistency, which means whatever information user has given, CPU should be able to see it as first as possible. That is the reason we want to disable caching. So, this bit enables or disable caching of the page.  

6. **Modified bit**<br>
Modified bit says whether the page has been modified or not. It is set to 1 by hardware on write-access to page which is used to avoid writing when swapped out. Sometimes this modified bit is also called as the Dirty bit.

### 7. [Swap Memory](http://www.faadooengineers.com/online-study/post/cse/operating-system/272/directory)  
Swap memory is the dedicated amount of hard drive that is used whenever RAM runs out of memory. There is a memory management program in Linux that takes care of this process. Whenever RAM is short of memory, the memory management program looks for all those inactive blocks of data present in RAM that have not been used for a long time.

**Types of Swap Memory:**
- **Swap Partition**  
This is the default type of swap memory which is in fact, a hard drive partition that is dedicated to swapping.  

- **Swap Partition**  
This is a self-created type of swap memory. Whenever there is no sufficient amount of space left in the hard drive to create a swap partition, a swap file is manually created for swapping the inactive contents of RAM into it.

### 8. [Static or Dynamic Loading](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_memory_management.htm)  
- **Static Loading**  
If you have to load your program statically, then at the time of compilation, the complete programs will be compiled and linked without leaving any external program or module dependency. At the time of loading, with static loading, the absolute program (and data) is loaded into memory in order for execution to start.

- **Dynamic Loading**  
If you are writing a Dynamically loaded program, then your compiler will compile the program and for all the modules which you want to include dynamically, only references will be provided and rest of the work will be done at the time of execution. If you are using dynamic loading, dynamic routines of the library are stored on a disk in relocatable form and are loaded into memory only when they are needed by the program.

### 9. [Memory Allocation](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_memory_management.htm)  
Operating system uses the following memory allocation mechanism.  

| Partition Allocation          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Single-Partition Allocation   | In this type of allocation, relocation-register scheme is used to  protect user processes from each other, and from changing  operating-system code and data. Relocation register contains value  of smallest physical address whereas limit register contains range  of logical addresses. Each logical address must be less than the  limit register. |
| Multiple-Partition Allocation | In this type of allocation, main memory is divided into a number of  fixed-sized partitions where each partition should contain only one  process. When a partition is free, a process is selected from the  input queue and is loaded into the free partition. When the process  terminates, the partition becomes available for another process.      |  
<br><br>

### 10. [Fragmentation](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_memory_management.htm)  
Fragmentation is the process of breaking the free memory space into little pieces. It happens after sometimes that processes cannot be allocated to memory blocks considering their small size and memory blocks remains unused.  
<br>
**The two types of Fragmentation:**  

| Fragmentation          | Description                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| External Fragmentation | Total memory space is enough to satisfy a request or to  reside a process in it, but it is not contiguous, so it  cannot be used. |
| Internal fragmentation | Memory block assigned to process is bigger. Some portion  of memory is left unused, as it cannot be used by another  process.     |

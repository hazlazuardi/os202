# Top 10 List of Week 01 

1. Operating System Services:
- User Interface:
The most common form of UI is GUI or Graphical UI. Here, the interface is a window system with 
a mouse that serves as a pointing device to direct I/O, choose from menus, and make selections 
and a keyboard to enter text. Mobile Phone use touch-screen interface. The other option is 
a CLI or Command-Line Interface.
- Services:
Services that help the user including Program Execution, I/O Operations, File Systems Manipulation, Communications, 
Error Detection. Services that ensure the efficient operation of the system itself including Resource Allocation,
Logging, and Protection and Security.


2. System Calls:
System calls provide an interface to the services made available by an operat- ing system. 
These calls are generally available as functions written in C and C++, although certain 
low-level tasks (for example, tasks where hardware must be accessed directly) may have to be 
written using assembly-language instructions.


3. Operating system structures:
- Monolithic Structure: The simplest structure for organizing an operating system no structure at all. 
That is, place all of the functionality of the kernel into a single, static binary file that runs in a 
single address space. There is very little overhead in the system-call interface, and communication within 
the kernels is fast. Despite the apparent simplicity of monolithic kernels, they are difficult to implement 
and extend. But their speed and efficiency explains why we still see the evidence of this structure in the UNIX, 
Linux and Windows OS.
- Layered Approach: Operating system is broken into numbers of layers. The main advantage od this approach is simplicity of
the construction and debugging. The layers are selected so that each uses functions and services of the only lower-level layers.
This approach simplifies debugging and system verification.
- Microkernels: This method structures the Operating System by removing all non-essential components from the kernel and implementing them as
user-level programs that reside in seperate address spaces. The main function is to provide communication between the client program 
and the various services that are also running in user space.
- Modules: The idea is for the kernel to provide core services, while other services are implemented dynamically, as the kernel is running.
This type of design is common in modern implementations of UNIX, such as Linux, macOS and Solaris Hybrid System.


4. Basic steps to generate/building an operating system:
- Write the operating system source code (or obtain previously written source code)
- Configure the operating system for the system on which it will run
- Compile the operating system
- Install the OS
- Boot the computer and its new operating system


5. Booting system:
The process of starting a computer by loading the kernel.
The steps are as follows:
- A small piece of code known as the bootstrap program or boot loader locates the kernel (GRUB for Linux)
- The kernel is loaded into memory and started
- The kernel initializes hardware
- The root file system is mounted (running)


6. Debugging:
Debugging is the process of detecting and removing of existing and potential errors (also called as ‘bugs’) 
in a software code that can cause it to behave unexpectedly or crash. To prevent incorrect operation of 
a software or system, debugging is used to find and resolve bugs or defects. When various subsystems or 
modules are tightly coupled, debugging becomes harder as any change in one module may cause more bugs 
to appear in another. Sometimes it takes more time to debug a program than to code it.


7. Virtualization is probably the most common method for running appliations designed for one OS on 
a different OS, but on the same CPU. But what if an application needs to run on a different CPU?
It is necessary to translate all of the source CPU's instructions so that they are turned into 
the equivalent instructions of the target CPU. Such an environment is no longer virtualized but 
rather is fully emulated. The major challenge of emulation is performance.


8. The virtualization requirements called for:
- Fidelity : A VMM provides an environment for programs that is essentially idenctical to the original machine
- Performance : Programs running within that environment show ony minor perofrmance decreases
- Safety : The VMM is in complete control of system resources


9. Virtualization and Operating-System Components:
- CPU scheduling
- Memory management
- I/O
- Storage management
- Live migration


10. Java Virtual Machine is a specification of an abstract computer. It consists of a class loader and a Java 
Interpreter that executes the architecture-neutral bytecodes. The JVM may be implemented in software on top 
of host operating system, such as Windows, Linux, MacOS, or as part of a web browser. It can also be 
implemented in a hardware on a chip specifically designed to run Java programs.

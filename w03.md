# Top 10 List of Week 03

### 1. [File Definition](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_file_system.htm#:~:text=A%20file%20is%20a%20named,the%20files%20creator%20and%20user.)
A file is a named collection of related information that is recorded on secondary storage such as magnetic disks, magnetic tapes and optical disks. In general, a file is a sequence of bits, bytes, lines or records whose meaning is defined by the files creator and user.

<br>  


### 2. [File Types](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_file_system.htm#:~:text=A%20file%20is%20a%20named,the%20files%20creator%20and%20user.)
- **Ordinary Files**  
  - Contains user information  
  - May have text, databases, or executable program  
  - Various operations can be applied such as add, moddify, delete, or remove the entire file  
<br>  

- **Directory Files**  
  - Contain list of file names and other information related to these files  
    <br>

- **Special Files** 
  - Also known as device files
  - Represent physical device like disks, terminals, printers, networks, tape drive etc  
    These files are of two types:  
  - Character special files: data is handled character by character as in case of terminals or printers  
  - Block special files: data is handled in blocks as in the case of disks and tapes  
<br><br>


### 3. [File Access Mechanism](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_file_system.htm#:~:text=A%20file%20is%20a%20named,the%20files%20creator%20and%20user.)  

- **Sequential Access**<br>
the records are accessed in some sequence, i.e., the information in the file is processed in order, one record after the other. This access method is the most primitive one. Example: Compilers usually access files in this fashion.  

- **Direct / Random Access**<br>  
    - Random access file organization provides, accessing the records directly.
    - Each record has its own address on the file with by the help of which it can be directly accessed for reading or writing.  
    - The records need not be in any sequence within the file and they need not be in adjacent locations on the storage medium.  

- **Indexed Sequential Access**<br> 
    - This mechanism is built up on base of sequential access.  
    - An index is created for each file which contains pointers to various blocks.  
    - Index is searched sequentially and its pointer is used to access the file directly  
    <br><br>


### 4. [Space Allocation](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_file_system.htm#:~:text=A%20file%20is%20a%20named,the%20files%20creator%20and%20user.)  

- **Contiguous Allocation**<br>
    - Each file occupies a contiguous address space on disk.  
    - Assigned disk address is in linear order.  
    - Easy to implement.  
    - External fragmentation is a major issue with this type of allocation technique. 

- **Linked Allocation**<br>
    - Each file carries a list of links to disk blocks.  
    - Directory contains link / pointer to first block of a file.  
    - No external fragmentation.  
    - Effectively used in sequential access file.  
    - Inefficient in case of direct access file.

- **Indexed Allocation**<br>
    - Provides solutions to problems of contiguous and linked allocation.  
    - A index block is created having all pointers to files.  
    - Each file has its own index block which stores the addresses of disk space occupied by the file.  
    - Directory contains the addresses of index blocks of files

### 5. [Directory Implementation](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-directory-implementation#:~:text=There%20is%20the%20number%20of,data%20structure%20they%20are%20using.)  

- **Linear List**<br>
All the files in a directory are maintained as singly lined list. Each file contains the pointers to the data blocks which are assigned to it and the next file in the directory.  

- **Hash Table**<br>
A key-value pair for each file in the directory gets generated and stored in the hash table. The key can be determined by applying the hash function on the file name while the key points to the corresponding file stored in the directory.
It's efficient, since the entire list will not be searched on every operating. Only hash table entries are checked using the key and if an entry found then the corresponding file will be fetched using the value  
<br><br>


### 6. [Free Space Management](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-directory-implementation#:~:text=There%20is%20the%20number%20of,data%20structure%20they%20are%20using.)  

- **Bitmap**<br>
Series or collection of bits where each bit corresponds to a disk block. It is simple to understand and finding the first free block is efficient.
- **Linked list**<br>
Free disk blocks are linked together.
- **Grouping**<br>
This approach stores the address of the free blocks in the first free block. This makes the addresses of a group of free disk blocks can be found easily.
- **Counting**<br>
Stores the address of the first free disk block and a number n of free contiguous disk blocks that follow the first block  
<br><br>


### 7. [Directory?](http://www.faadooengineers.com/online-study/post/cse/operating-system/272/directory)  
Directory can be viewed as a symbol table that translates file names into their directory entries. The operations that can be performed on the directory are:
- Search for a file
- Create a file
- Delete a file
- List a directory
- Rename a file
- Traverse the file system  
<br><br>


### 8. [File System Structure](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-file-system-structure)  
File System provide efficient access to the disk by allowing data to be stored, located and retrieved in a convenient way. A file System must be able to store the file, locate the file and retrieve the file.
Most of the Operating Systems use layering approach for every task including file systems. Every layer of the file system is responsible for some activities. The layers are:
1. **Application Programs**
2. **Logical File System**
3. **File Organization Module**
4. **Basic File System**
5. **I/O Control**
6. **Devices**  
<br><br>


### 9. [Remote File Systems](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/introduction-to-remote-file-systems)
Remote file systems enable an application that runs on a client computer to access files stored on a different computer. Remote file systems also often make other resources (ex: remote printers) accessible from a client computer  
<br><br>

### 10. [Virtual File System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_file_system)  
An abstract layer on top of a more concrete file system. The purpose of a VFS is to allow client applications to access different types of concrete file systems in a uniform way.
